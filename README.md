# Houdini Axis to Nuke

This contains the original source code and also the HDA and the Nuke Gizmo. 
Connect the HDA to a null from the animation. Select the button and this will create an .abc and a .json.
if you head over to nuke and create the gizmo it will ask you to select the .json. When you are done you can see the axis node will follow the animation.
